# HumansTxt Plugin for Publii

The HumansTxt plugin allows [Publii](https://getpublii.com) users to easily create and manage a [`humans.txt`](https://github.com/htejera/awesome-humans.txt) file directly from the Publii interface. This file is used to provide information about the different people who have contributed to building the website. More information about this initiative can be found at [humanstxt.org](http://humanstxt.org/).

## Features

- **Create and Edit `humans.txt`**: Users can directly input the content they wish to include in their `humans.txt` file via a simple textarea in the plugin settings.
- **Automatic Update Date**: Optionally append the last updated date to the `humans.txt` file to reflect the most recent changes.
- **Customizable Update Text**: Users can specify custom text to precede the automatic update date, allowing for localization or personalization.

## Installation

1. Download the plugin from the [Release page](#).
2. In Publii, go to "Plugins" > "Add new" and select the downloaded ZIP file
3. Activate the plugin.
4. Go to the "Plugins" section in the Publii app and enable the "HumansTxt".

## Configuration

2. **Include Update Date**: Toggle this option to append the last updated date to your `humans.txt` file automatically.
